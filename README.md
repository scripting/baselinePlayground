# baselinePlayground

A <a href="http://scripting.com/code/baselineplayground/">prototype</a> of what a story page might look like on our baseline site for WordLand. 

Quick to iterate and tweak, to share ideas with people working on the WordPress theme for a site.

### Why post it publicly?

I never made one of these before and thought it was worth sharing, or just writing about.

The thing is that creating a theme for a WordPress site is complicated. So I asked a longtime friend Scott Hanson, to do the WordPress work, and I would contribute as a writer and someone who uses CSS to design applications, and has never really liked doing it for websites. I have had luck with this approach when both perspectives are needed to develop something, and if you try to do both, you don't get something good from either perspective. We did this a lot at UserLand and before that at Living Videotext. I learned it from Mitch Kapor when we were both at Personal Software in the 80s.

Anyway, it might become handy if WordLand catches on and others want to experiment with interfaces for their sites, and be able to make changes quickly to try out new ideas.
