We had to undo this change, so no more styles2.css. Everything reverts to how it was before and I will come up with another file to contain the CSS.

I can now make changes to daveverse.org styles by editing styles.css here. 

I created a styles2.css for inclusion in the app here, so there are two distinct files. 

I can still prototyp in the playground by editing styles2.css.

.divStory -- removed border, padding

Made this a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/baselinePlayground">GitHub project</a>.

Cleaned up line-height, it should simply be a property of divStory, and not specified separately for lists and paragraphs.
